('Fire burns US Embassy entrance in Honduras amid privatization protests', 'Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) The main entrance of the US Embassy in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa was left charred Friday after demonstrators set fire to tires and objects in front of the building. The fire was extinguished by mid-afternoon, and a State Department spokesperson later said no embassy personnel were injured in the incident.\n\nThe fire came amid days of protests by education and medical professionals, who are urging the government not to privatize their sectors. The US Embassy had previously instructed the families of US government employees to remain home during the protests.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the embassy was the intended target of the demonstrators.\n\nA senior State Department official told CNN the incident did not appear to be serious and that staffers were seeking more information from the scene.\n\nThe State Department spokesperson for Western Hemisphere Affairs later called the fire an "unacceptable" act of "violence," and said the embassy was working "closely" with Honduran authorities.\n\nRead More', '2019-05-31 00:00:00', 7, 10, 157, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, 0),
('Japan F-35 fighter crash: Pilot suffered \'spatial disorientation\'', 'Tokyo (CNN) The sudden crash of a Japanese F-35 stealth fighter into the Pacific Ocean in April this year was likely caused by the "spatial disorientation" of its pilot, the country\'s defense minister said Monday.\n\nThe Japan Air Self-Defense Force jet, among the world\'s most sophisticated aircraft, disappeared from radar while on a training mission with three other F-35s off northern Japan on April 9. There was no indication from the jet\'s pilot, Maj. Akinori Hosomi, of any problems with the aircraft before contact was lost.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense said Monday that Hosomi, a 41-year-old with 3,200 hours of flight experience, essentially flew the stealth fighter straight into the ocean during the night training mission.\n\nSpatial disorientation is defined as "a situation in which a pilot cannot sense correctly the position, attitude, altitude, or the motion of an airplane," according to a 2009 study on Japan\'s Air Self-Defense Force in the journal Military Medicine.\n\nThe effects are worse at night, according to the study, which said at the time that 12% of Japanese military air accidents were caused by spatial disorientation.\n\nRead More', '2019-06-10 00:00:00', 7, 10, 158, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, 0),
('These North Korean defectors were sold into China as cybersex slaves. Then they escaped', 'Jilin, China (CNN) Wearing big black headphones and sitting on a blue floral bedspread, North Korean defector Lee Yumi was video chatting with yet another stranger online, dark rings shading the pale skin under her eyes.\n\nFor five years, Lee -- whose name has been changed for her safety -- says she had been imprisoned with a handful of other girls in a tiny apartment in northeast China, after the broker she trusted to plan her escape from North Korea sold her to a cybersex operator. Her captor allowed her to leave the apartment once every six months. Attempts to escape had failed.\n\nLee\'s story is shared by thousands of North Korean girls and women, some as young as 9 years old, who are being abducted or trafficked to work in China\'s multimillion-dollar sex trade, according to a report by the London-based non-profit organization Korea Future Initiative (KFI).\n\nNorth Korean women are often enslaved in brothels, sold into repressive marriages or made to perform graphic acts in front of webcams in satellite towns near cities close to China\'s border with North Korea, the KFI found. If caught by the Chinese authorities, they face repatriation to North Korea where defectors are often tortured. CNN was not able to independently verify claims made in the report.\n\nLee, however, had just found a lifeline. The stranger the 28-year-old was talking to online was not a cybersex customer. He was a South Korean pastor -- and he had promised to save her.\n\n"Don\'t worry, we are going to rescue you," he said.\n\nLee smiled weakly and started to tear up, before typing back: "Thank you. I\'m afraid."\n\nThe blurred faces of the two women who escaped from cybersex slavery.\n\nEscape from North Korea\n\nThere are no official statistics showing exactly how many North Koreans have fled their country, which is home to about 25 million people . South Korea says it has welcomed more than 32,000 defectors since 1998. Last year alone, the country received 1,137 defectors -- and 85% of them were women.\n\n"It is much easier for them to flee, because they are not usually enrolled in formal employment at a factory or a state firm where any absence would be immediately reported," said Yeo Sang Yoon, from the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, an NGO in Seoul. "They are in charge of the household and can thus slip away unnoticed."\n\nLee grew up in a family of low-level party cadres in North Korea.\n\n"We had enough food," she said. "We even had rice and wheat stored in the garage." But Lee felt her parents were too strict. "I had to be home before sundown, and they didn\'t allow me to study medicine."\n\nOne day, after getting into a fight with them, she decided to cross the border into China. Lee said she found a broker to facilitate the dangerous move who promised her a job in a restaurant.\n\nThat promise turned out to be a lie.\n\nUsually, women like Lee pay brokers $500 to $1,000 to organize their safe passage to China, according to NGOs and defector accounts.\n\nTo reach China, many defectors cross the Tumen River that separates North Korea from China on foot at night, sometimes in freezing weather with the water coming up to their shoulders.\n\nAfter Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, border security was tightened to avoid the bad publicity associated with defections and prevent information about North Korea trickling into the country, according to Tim Peters, an American pastor who co-founded an NGO called Helping Hands that helps defectors flee. An electric fence was added, as well as cameras at the border.\n\n"On the Chinese side, patrols were also increased because Beijing is afraid an influx of refugees could destabilize its own regime," he added.\n\nNorth Korea is visible from Yanji in China.\n\nTwo huge portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il hang at the entrance of a bridge linking the two countries.\n\nOnce on Chinese soil, defectors must reach the city of Tumen that sits right up against the icy river, in a lunar landscape of barren hills. North Korea is visible from the town -- farmers in a village there can be seen plowing their fields with antique machinery.\n\nLee crossed the Tumen River in a group of eight girls.\n\nWhen she arrived in China, Lee said she was taken to a apartment on the fourth floor of a pale yellow building in Yanji, a city in Jilin province about 50 kilometers from Tumen, where most signs are written in Korean and Chinese and scores of restaurants sell bibimbap and kimchi, due to the large population of ethnic Koreans.\n\nYanji has a large population of ethnic Koreans. Many signs are written in Korean.\n\nAt the apartment, she realized there was no restaurant job.\n\nInstead, Lee said her broker had sold her for 30,000 yuan (about $4,500) to the operator of a cybersex chatroom.\n\n"When I found out, I felt so humiliated," she whispered. "I started crying and asked to leave, but the boss said he had paid a lot of money for me and I now had a debt towards him."\n\nKorean NGOs estimate that 70% to 80% of North Korean women who make it to China are trafficked, for between 6,000 and 30,000 yuan ($890 to $4,500), depending on their age and beauty.\n\nSome are sold as brides to Chinese farmers; more recently, girls have increasingly been trafficked into the cybersex industry, according to the KFI.\n\nRising wages in northern China cities have led to a greater demand for prostitutes among the male population, according to the KFI report. In southern China, trafficked women from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia has typically met that demand. But in northeastern provinces, men have turned to North Korean refugees.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese government said in a statement to CNN: "I want to stress that the Chinese government pays high attention to foreign citizens\' legitimate rights according to law, also combat activities of human trafficking women and child."\n\nMichael Glendinning, director of the KFI, said the Chinese government was "not doing enough to protect North Korean women and girls in its territory at all."\n\n"China must work to crack down on the networks and individuals -- including Chinese public officials -- responsible for the trafficking of North Korean women and girls, he said. "But it must do so in a way that ensures that these women and girls are not repatriated to North Korea where they would face torture, imprisonment, and possibly extrajudicial killing."\n\nTwo other North Korean women already lived in the two-bedroom apartment Lee was delivered to. One was 27 years old, had her own bedroom and seemed close to the chatroom boss. "I think she was supposed to spy on us," said Lee.\n\nThe other girl was Kwang Ha-Yoon, whose name has been changed to protect her identity for her safety. Kwang was 19 years old and had been locked up for two years when Lee arrived.\n\n"My parents split up when I was very young and I grew up with my mother and grandparents," she said. "We never had enough to eat." Kwang left North Korea to earn money to send to her family. "Both my mother and my grandmother had cancer and needed treatment," she said.\n\nBut all the money Kwang earned in China went to her captor.\n\nLee and Kwang had to share a room.\n\n"The only furniture was two beds, two tables and two computers," recalled Kwang. "Every morning, I would get up around 11 a.m., have breakfast and then start working until dawn the next day." Sometimes, she would only get four hours of sleep. If they complained, they would get beaten, although both women said they did not suffer sexual abuse by their captor.\n\nWork involved logging onto an online chat platform on which South Korean men can pay to watch girls perform sexual acts.\n\nWithin minutes of logging on to the site, users are barraged by women on the platform sending text messages asking for a video chat in a private room.\n\nThey all claim to be from a major city in South Korea. The minimum price to chat on the site is 150 won (13 cents), but girls can set the entry price for a room, with popular accounts tending to have a more expensive entry fee. Tips start at a minimum of 300 won (25 cents), but can go far higher as customers try to persuade the girls to fulfill their requests. Lee and Kwang were tasked by their captors with keeping the men online for as long as possible. In South Korea, where prostitution is illegal, these services have become increasingly popular in recent years.\n\nMany of the women working in the city\'s numerous K-TV and cybersex chatrooms are North Korean defectors.\n\nCNN reached out to the platform to ask what steps it takes to protect women like Lee and Kwang on its site, but the company did not respond.\n\n"Some of the men just wanted to talk, but most wanted more," said Lee, with a shudder of disgust. "They would ask me to take suggestive poses or to undress and touch myself. I had to do everything they asked."\n\n"I felt like dying 1,000 times, but I couldn\'t even kill myself as the boss was always watching us," she said.\n\nHer captor was a man of South Korean descent who slept in the living room to keep a close eye on the women.\n\n"The front door was always locked from the outside and there was no handle on the inside," said Kwang. "Every six months, he would take us out to the park."\n\nOn this small patch of green next to their apartment, retirees would meet to dance to music each afternoon.\n\nThe park where the chatroom boss would sometimes bring them, right next to the building where they were held.\n\n"During those outings, he would always stay right next to us, so we never got to talk to anyone," said Lee. In 2015, Lee tried to escape by climbing out of a window and down a metal drain, but she fell and hurt her back and leg. She still limps slightly.\n\nWhen their captor wanted something from the girls, he would try to sweet talk them, promising a cut of their earnings or to let them go free to work in South Korea one day.\n\nBut when Kwang asked for a piece of the 60 million won (around $51,000) she estimated she had made for him, he got angry.\n\n"He started kicking, slapping and cursing me," she said.\n\nDuring the seven years Kwang spent locked up in his apartment, she said he never gave her a cent.\n\nA ray of light\n\nIt was during the summer of 2018 that Lee finally saw her chance to escape.\n\n"One of my customers realized I was North Korean and was being held captive," said Lee. While most men probably knew the girls weren\'t South Korean, because North Koreans have different accents and dialects to people in the south, they chose to look the other way.\n\nThis man was different.\n\n"He bought a laptop and let me take control of the screen remotely, so I could send messages without my boss noticing," Lee said.\n\nThe man also gave her the phone number of a South Korean pastor named Chun Ki-Won.\n\nPastor Chun Ki-Won has been helping North Korean defectors flee for 20 years. He has been nicknamed the Asian Schindler.\n\nChun, a mild-mannered man with high cheekbones and wavy gray hair, is one of a band of Korean pastors who specialize in helping North Korean women escape from China. Chun said his Christian aid organization, Durihana, has helped over 1,000 defectors reach Seoul since 1999. Korean media has nicknamed him the Asian Schindler , after the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews.\n\n"In the past few years, dozens of missionaries linked to my organization have been deported from China," he said from his Seoul office that overflowed with plants, books and religious figurines. "There are only a few left, and they have to stay on the move constantly to avoid being arrested."\n\nChina is a close ally of Pyongyang and doesn\'t consider North Korean defectors refugees, instead seeing them as illegal economic migrants. "When it catches them, it sends them back (to North Korea), where they face torture, internment in a labor camp and sometimes death," said Lee Eunkoo, the co-founder of Teach North Korean Refugees, an NGO that helps defectors learn English.\n\nIn September 2018, Lee contacted Pastor Chun on KakaoTalk, a Korean messaging service.\n\n"Hi, I want to go to South Korea. Can you help me?" read the first message she sent.\n\nOver the following weeks, Lee explained to Chun how she had ended up in a cybersex chatroom. He asked her about the apartment\'s layout and her boss\' comings and goings.\n\nBy mid-October a plan had been hatched: Chun would send a team to Yanji to extract Lee and Kwang.\n\nLee Yumi and Kwang Ha-Yoon escaping from the cybersex chatroom where they were held captive. They used a rope to reach the ground from the fourth floor.\n\nOn October 26, while Yumi\'s boss was away for the day, Durihana\'s members arrived at the foot of the building. The two girls knotted their bedsheets together and dropped them out of their window. The extraction team then tied a rope to the sheets, which the girls pulled up and used to lower themselves safely to the ground.\n\nThey were only able to take a small backpack with a couple of essentials -- a pack of wet wipes and a comb. They jumped into a car and sped away.\n\nThe whole operation took minutes.\n\nJourney to the south\n\nKorean pastors have set up a network of routes and safe houses in China inspired by the Underground Railroad, the secret passages enslaved African-Americans used to escape to free states from the late 1700s until the US Civil War.\n\n"Each individual cell knows nothing about the other ones, to avoid compromising the whole operation if one of them gets caught," said Tim Peters, the American pastor living in Seoul who is helping North Koreans flee.\n\nBefore 1998, defectors would simply knock on the door of the South Korean consulate general in Shenyang, the capital of neighboring Liaoning province, around 790 kilometers (490 miles) from the border with North Korea.\n\nBut during the Sunshine Policy era (1998 to 2008), which saw a rapprochement between Seoul and Pyongyang, several refugees were deported to North Korea from the Shenyang consulate, according to the book "Escape from North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia\'s Underground Railroad" by Melanie Kirkpatrick. Defectors then started crossing the Gobi desert into Mongolia, aiming to reach the South Korean embassy in the capital. But that route closed in 2010, when Ulaanbaatar reinstated strong diplomatic links with North Korea.\n\nThe only option left was to go south through China, hoping to reach a country that wouldn\'t send North Korean refugees home.\n\nLee Yumi and Kwang Ha-Yoon have just arrived in the capital of a Southeast Asian country, after crossing the border with China on foot illegally. They have been traveling for 50 hours.\n\nAfter escaping Yanji, Lee and Kwang said they went across China on buses and trains using fake Korean passports. Their last stop was Kunming, in China\'s deep southwest. From there, most defectors cross the border illegally into Laos or Myanmar and either head for the South Korean Embassy in the capital cities of those countries, or continue to Bangkok, in Thailand. CNN has not revealed which country Lee and Kwang traveled to for security reasons.\n\nLee and Kwang met with a Chinese man who took them across the mountains into a neighboring country.\n\n"We walked for five hours through the jungle, before reaching a road where a car was waiting for us," said Kwang. Chun later met them in the middle of the night on the side of a road. "I burst into tears as soon as I saw him," said Kwang, who is now 24 years old. "For the first time in a very long time, I felt safe."\n\nAfter two more days of traveling by car and bus, they reached the capital city. "We were stopped several times by the police for routine checks, I was terrified," said Kwang.\n\nIn total, they said their journey from Kunming took 50 hours.\n\nAs they rode towards the embassy in a tuk tuk, Lee stared giddily at the urban landscape unfolding before her eyes. "I\'m so happy!" she said, as the embassy approached. Kwang was more nervous. "I know I should feel joy, but I just feel empty," she said. "I don\'t know what to expect, and I am afraid of the interrogations at the embassy."\n\nPastor Chun Ki-Won joined the women along the way, after meeting them on the side of a road in the middle of the night.\n\nAt 5.30 p.m., the two defectors and Chun walked up to the black and golden gate of Seoul\'s diplomatic representation. Before they had a chance to ring the bell, they said a man in a black shirt opened the door and ushered them inside with a smile.\n\nA few minutes later, Chun walked out -- alone.\n\nThe embassy, which receives about 10 defectors a month, according to officials, kept the women for about 10 days for questioning.

Police estimated it at closer to 240,000.\n\nIt\'s a death knell that\'s been repeated countless times but never come true.\n\nSince 1997, China has embraced a ruthless brand of capitalism -- and concerns have shifted to the erosion of the city\'s unique political system, which allows citizens political freedoms unavailable in China. However, so far these haven\'t caused Hong Kong\'s economy to flinch.\n\nGDP figures have remained strong, the market stable and house prices have continued to soar due to Chinese investment and speculation.\n\nBut a controversial bill that would allow extradition to China, which prompted as many as 1 million people protest in Hong Kong on Sunday , could change this for one simple reason.\n\nThis time the challenges facing Hong Kong are seen as a direct threat to its business community.\n\n"The main concern is that the extradition law will expose foreign executives based in Hong Kong to the capriciousness of mainland China\'s justice system," said Duncan Innes-Ker, Asia regional director at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nUnder the new bill, business people fear they could be grabbed from Hong Kong by Chinese authorities for political reasons or inadvertent business offenses, undermining the city\'s semi-autonomous legal system.\n\n"The credibility of Hong Kong is now on the line," Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, said this week.\n\nHow much risk is worth it?\n\nIn recent weeks, foreign business groups -- which usually take a neutral stance on contentious political issues -- have come out against the law. In private, executives have been lobbying against it, warning lawmakers it could harm Hong Kong\'s reputation as a safe harbor in which to base their China and Asia headquarters.\n\nAn executive at a major international firm based in Hong Kong, who requested not to be named due to sensitivities around criticizing the government, acknowledged that "international businesses have always faced some degree of risk when operating outside of their home country."\n\n"(But) Hong Kong\'s value has been in its ability to mitigate those risks through the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and an independent judiciary," he explained.\n\nHe added that international business leaders in Hong Kong will need to evaluate how much extra risk they feel the extradition law will pose to their businesses and weigh that against alternative business locations.\n\nWith its punishingly expensive office space, Hong Kong is already facing competition from other regional hubs for international investment. Singapore has emerged as a strong rival, along with Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nJUST WATCHED \'I am calling on HK people to think of smarter ways to fight,\' says Denise Ho Replay More Videos ...

Trade unions have also suggested they might call on members to stop work in protest.\n\n"As a small businessman, I believe strike is the most effective way ... to voice my appeals," said Conrad Wu, of removals company Call4Van. "I call on other shops to join the strike as only a large-scale action can raise the awareness that Hong Kong people will not tolerate the extradition law."\n\nAbouThai, a beauty retailer with 13 branches across Hong Kong, said in a statement that "we can earn back profit lost on that day, but we cannot save Hong Kong once we lose it."\n\nJUST WATCHED Organizers say over one million marched in Hong Kong Replay More Videos ...

('These North Korean defectors were sold into China as cybersex slaves. Then they escaped', 'Jilin, China (CNN) Wearing big black headphones and sitting on a blue floral bedspread, North Korean defector Lee Yumi was video chatting with yet another stranger online, dark rings shading the pale skin under her eyes.\n\nFor five years, Lee -- whose name has been changed for her safety -- says she had been imprisoned with a handful of other girls in a tiny apartment in northeast China, after the broker she trusted to plan her escape from North Korea sold her to a cybersex operator. Her captor allowed her to leave the apartment once every six months. Attempts to escape had failed.\n\nLee\'s story is shared by thousands of North Korean girls and women, some as young as 9 years old, who are being abducted or trafficked to work in China\'s multimillion-dollar sex trade, according to a report by the London-based non-profit organization Korea Future Initiative (KFI).\n\nNorth Korean women are often enslaved in brothels, sold into repressive marriages or made to perform graphic acts in front of webcams in satellite towns near cities close to China\'s border with North Korea, the KFI found. If caught by the Chinese authorities, they face repatriation to North Korea where defectors are often tortured. CNN was not able to independently verify claims made in the report.\n\nLee, however, had just found a lifeline. The stranger the 28-year-old was talking to online was not a cybersex customer. He was a South Korean pastor -- and he had promised to save her.\n\n"Don\'t worry, we are going to rescue you," he said.\n\nLee smiled weakly and started to tear up, before typing back: "Thank you. I\'m afraid."\n\nThe blurred faces of the two women who escaped from cybersex slavery.\n\nEscape from North Korea\n\nThere are no official statistics showing exactly how many North Koreans have fled their country, which is home to about 25 million people . South Korea says it has welcomed more than 32,000 defectors since 1998. Last year alone, the country received 1,137 defectors -- and 85% of them were women.\n\n"It is much easier for them to flee, because they are not usually enrolled in formal employment at a factory or a state firm where any absence would be immediately reported," said Yeo Sang Yoon, from the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, an NGO in Seoul. "They are in charge of the household and can thus slip away unnoticed."\n\nLee grew up in a family of low-level party cadres in North Korea.\n\n"We had enough food," she said. "We even had rice and wheat stored in the garage." But Lee felt her parents were too strict. "I had to be home before sundown, and they didn\'t allow me to study medicine."\n\nOne day, after getting into a fight with them, she decided to cross the border into China. Lee said she found a broker to facilitate the dangerous move who promised her a job in a restaurant.\n\nThat promise turned out to be a lie.\n\nUsually, women like Lee pay brokers $500 to $1,000 to organize their safe passage to China, according to NGOs and defector accounts.\n\nTo reach China, many defectors cross the Tumen River that separates North Korea from China on foot at night, sometimes in freezing weather with the water coming up to their shoulders.\n\nAfter Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, border security was tightened to avoid the bad publicity associated with defections and prevent information about North Korea trickling into the country, according to Tim Peters, an American pastor who co-founded an NGO called Helping Hands that helps defectors flee. An electric fence was added, as well as cameras at the border.\n\n"On the Chinese side, patrols were also increased because Beijing is afraid an influx of refugees could destabilize its own regime," he added.\n\nNorth Korea is visible from Yanji in China.\n\nTwo huge portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il hang at the entrance of a bridge linking the two countries.\n\nOnce on Chinese soil, defectors must reach the city of Tumen that sits right up against the icy river, in a lunar landscape of barren hills. North Korea is visible from the town -- farmers in a village there can be seen plowing their fields with antique machinery.\n\nLee crossed the Tumen River in a group of eight girls.\n\nWhen she arrived in China, Lee said she was taken to a apartment on the fourth floor of a pale yellow building in Yanji, a city in Jilin province about 50 kilometers from Tumen, where most signs are written in Korean and Chinese and scores of restaurants sell bibimbap and kimchi, due to the large population of ethnic Koreans.\n\nYanji has a large population of ethnic Koreans. Many signs are written in Korean.\n\nAt the apartment, she realized there was no restaurant job.\n\nInstead, Lee said her broker had sold her for 30,000 yuan (about $4,500) to the operator of a cybersex chatroom.\n\n"When I found out, I felt so humiliated," she whispered. "I started crying and asked to leave, but the boss said he had paid a lot of money for me and I now had a debt towards him."\n\nKorean NGOs estimate that 70% to 80% of North Korean women who make it to China are trafficked, for between 6,000 and 30,000 yuan ($890 to $4,500), depending on their age and beauty.\n\nSome are sold as brides to Chinese farmers; more recently, girls have increasingly been trafficked into the cybersex industry, according to the KFI.\n\nRising wages in northern China cities have led to a greater demand for prostitutes among the male population, according to the KFI report. In southern China, trafficked women from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia has typically met that demand. But in northeastern provinces, men have turned to North Korean refugees.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese government said in a statement to CNN: "I want to stress that the Chinese government pays high attention to foreign citizens\' legitimate rights according to law, also combat activities of human trafficking women and child."\n\nMichael Glendinning, director of the KFI, said the Chinese government was "not doing enough to protect North Korean women and girls in its territory at all."\n\n"China must work to crack down on the networks and individuals -- including Chinese public officials -- responsible for the trafficking of North Korean women and girls, he said. "But it must do so in a way that ensures that these women and girls are not repatriated to North Korea where they would face torture, imprisonment, and possibly extrajudicial killing."\n\nTwo other North Korean women already lived in the two-bedroom apartment Lee was delivered to. One was 27 years old, had her own bedroom and seemed close to the chatroom boss. "I think she was supposed to spy on us," said Lee.\n\nThe other girl was Kwang Ha-Yoon, whose name has been changed to protect her identity for her safety. Kwang was 19 years old and had been locked up for two years when Lee arrived.\n\n"My parents split up when I was very young and I grew up with my mother and grandparents," she said. "We never had enough to eat." Kwang left North Korea to earn money to send to her family. "Both my mother and my grandmother had cancer and needed treatment," she said.\n\nBut all the money Kwang earned in China went to her captor.\n\nLee and Kwang had to share a room.\n\n"The only furniture was two beds, two tables and two computers," recalled Kwang. "Every morning, I would get up around 11 a.m., have breakfast and then start working until dawn the next day." Sometimes, she would only get four hours of sleep. If they complained, they would get beaten, although both women said they did not suffer sexual abuse by their captor.\n\nWork involved logging onto an online chat platform on which South Korean men can pay to watch girls perform sexual acts.\n\nWithin minutes of logging on to the site, users are barraged by women on the platform sending text messages asking for a video chat in a private room.\n\nThey all claim to be from a major city in South Korea. The minimum price to chat on the site is 150 won (13 cents), but girls can set the entry price for a room, with popular accounts tending to have a more expensive entry fee. Tips start at a minimum of 300 won (25 cents), but can go far higher as customers try to persuade the girls to fulfill their requests. Lee and Kwang were tasked by their captors with keeping the men online for as long as possible. In South Korea, where prostitution is illegal, these services have become increasingly popular in recent years.\n\nMany of the women working in the city\'s numerous K-TV and cybersex chatrooms are North Korean defectors.\n\nCNN reached out to the platform to ask what steps it takes to protect women like Lee and Kwang on its site, but the company did not respond.\n\n"Some of the men just wanted to talk, but most wanted more," said Lee, with a shudder of disgust. "They would ask me to take suggestive poses or to undress and touch myself. I had to do everything they asked."\n\n"I felt like dying 1,000 times, but I couldn\'t even kill myself as the boss was always watching us," she said.\n\nHer captor was a man of South Korean descent who slept in the living room to keep a close eye on the women.\n\n"The front door was always locked from the outside and there was no handle on the inside," said Kwang. "Every six months, he would take us out to the park."\n\nOn this small patch of green next to their apartment, retirees would meet to dance to music each afternoon.\n\nThe park where the chatroom boss would sometimes bring them, right next to the building where they were held.\n\n"During those outings, he would always stay right next to us, so we never got to talk to anyone," said Lee. In 2015, Lee tried to escape by climbing out of a window and down a metal drain, but she fell and hurt her back and leg. She still limps slightly.\n\nWhen their captor wanted something from the girls, he would try to sweet talk them, promising a cut of their earnings or to let them go free to work in South Korea one day.\n\nBut when Kwang asked for a piece of the 60 million won (around $51,000) she estimated she had made for him, he got angry.\n\n"He started kicking, slapping and cursing me," she said.\n\nDuring the seven years Kwang spent locked up in his apartment, she said he never gave her a cent.\n\nA ray of light\n\nIt was during the summer of 2018 that Lee finally saw her chance to escape.\n\n"One of my customers realized I was North Korean and was being held captive," said Lee. While most men probably knew the girls weren\'t South Korean, because North Koreans have different accents and dialects to people in the south, they chose to look the other way.\n\nThis man was different.\n\n"He bought a laptop and let me take control of the screen remotely, so I could send messages without my boss noticing," Lee said.\n\nThe man also gave her the phone number of a South Korean pastor named Chun Ki-Won.\n\nPastor Chun Ki-Won has been helping North Korean defectors flee for 20 years. He has been nicknamed the Asian Schindler.\n\nChun, a mild-mannered man with high cheekbones and wavy gray hair, is one of a band of Korean pastors who specialize in helping North Korean women escape from China. Chun said his Christian aid organization, Durihana, has helped over 1,000 defectors reach Seoul since 1999. Korean media has nicknamed him the Asian Schindler , after the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews.\n\n"In the past few years, dozens of missionaries linked to my organization have been deported from China," he said from his Seoul office that overflowed with plants, books and religious figurines. "There are only a few left, and they have to stay on the move constantly to avoid being arrested."\n\nChina is a close ally of Pyongyang and doesn\'t consider North Korean defectors refugees, instead seeing them as illegal economic migrants. "When it catches them, it sends them back (to North Korea), where they face torture, internment in a labor camp and sometimes death," said Lee Eunkoo, the co-founder of Teach North Korean Refugees, an NGO that helps defectors learn English.\n\nIn September 2018, Lee contacted Pastor Chun on KakaoTalk, a Korean messaging service.\n\n"Hi, I want to go to South Korea. Can you help me?" read the first message she sent.\n\nOver the following weeks, Lee explained to Chun how she had ended up in a cybersex chatroom. He asked her about the apartment\'s layout and her boss\' comings and goings.\n\nBy mid-October a plan had been hatched: Chun would send a team to Yanji to extract Lee and Kwang.\n\nLee Yumi and Kwang Ha-Yoon escaping from the cybersex chatroom where they were held captive. They used a rope to reach the ground from the fourth floor.\n\nOn October 26, while Yumi\'s boss was away for the day, Durihana\'s members arrived at the foot of the building. The two girls knotted their bedsheets together and dropped them out of their window. The extraction team then tied a rope to the sheets, which the girls pulled up and used to lower themselves safely to the ground.\n\nThey were only able to take a small backpack with a couple of essentials -- a pack of wet wipes and a comb. They jumped into a car and sped away.\n\nThe whole operation took minutes.\n\nJourney to the south\n\nKorean pastors have set up a network of routes and safe houses in China inspired by the Underground Railroad, the secret passages enslaved African-Americans used to escape to free states from the late 1700s until the US Civil War.\n\n"Each individual cell knows nothing about the other ones, to avoid compromising the whole operation if one of them gets caught," said Tim Peters, the American pastor living in Seoul who is helping North Koreans flee.\n\nBefore 1998, defectors would simply knock on the door of the South Korean consulate general in Shenyang, the capital of neighboring Liaoning province, around 790 kilometers (490 miles) from the border with North Korea.\n\nBut during the Sunshine Policy era (1998 to 2008), which saw a rapprochement between Seoul and Pyongyang, several refugees were deported to North Korea from the Shenyang consulate, according to the book "Escape from North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia\'s Underground Railroad" by Melanie Kirkpatrick. Defectors then started crossing the Gobi desert into Mongolia, aiming to reach the South Korean embassy in the capital. But that route closed in 2010, when Ulaanbaatar reinstated strong diplomatic links with North Korea.\n\nThe only option left was to go south through China, hoping to reach a country that wouldn\'t send North Korean refugees home.\n\nLee Yumi and Kwang Ha-Yoon have just arrived in the capital of a Southeast Asian country, after crossing the border with China on foot illegally. They have been traveling for 50 hours.\n\nAfter escaping Yanji, Lee and Kwang said they went across China on buses and trains using fake Korean passports. Their last stop was Kunming, in China\'s deep southwest. From there, most defectors cross the border illegally into Laos or Myanmar and either head for the South Korean Embassy in the capital cities of those countries, or continue to Bangkok, in Thailand. CNN has not revealed which country Lee and Kwang traveled to for security reasons.\n\nLee and Kwang met with a Chinese man who took them across the mountains into a neighboring country.\n\n"We walked for five hours through the jungle, before reaching a road where a car was waiting for us," said Kwang. Chun later met them in the middle of the night on the side of a road. "I burst into tears as soon as I saw him," said Kwang, who is now 24 years old. "For the first time in a very long time, I felt safe."\n\nAfter two more days of traveling by car and bus, they reached the capital city. "We were stopped several times by the police for routine checks, I was terrified," said Kwang.\n\nIn total, they said their journey from Kunming took 50 hours.\n\nAs they rode towards the embassy in a tuk tuk, Lee stared giddily at the urban landscape unfolding before her eyes. "I\'m so happy!" she said, as the embassy approached. Kwang was more nervous. "I know I should feel joy, but I just feel empty," she said. "I don\'t know what to expect, and I am afraid of the interrogations at the embassy."\n\nPastor Chun Ki-Won joined the women along the way, after meeting them on the side of a road in the middle of the night.\n\nAt 5.30 p.m., the two defectors and Chun walked up to the black and golden gate of Seoul\'s diplomatic representation. Before they had a chance to ring the bell, they said a man in a black shirt opened the door and ushered them inside with a smile.\n\nA few minutes later, Chun walked out -- alone.\n\nThe embassy, which receives about 10 defectors a month, according to officials, kept the women for about 10 days for questioning.

However, so far these haven\'t caused Hong Kong\'s economy to flinch.\n\nGDP figures have remained strong, the market stable and house prices have continued to soar due to Chinese investment and speculation.\n\nBut a controversial bill that would allow extradition to China, which prompted as many as 1 million people protest in Hong Kong on Sunday , could change this for one simple reason.\n\nThis time the challenges facing Hong Kong are seen as a direct threat to its business community.\n\n"The main concern is that the extradition law will expose foreign executives based in Hong Kong to the capriciousness of mainland China\'s justice system," said Duncan Innes-Ker, Asia regional director at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nUnder the new bill, business people fear they could be grabbed from Hong Kong by Chinese authorities for political reasons or inadvertent business offenses, undermining the city\'s semi-autonomous legal system.\n\n"The credibility of Hong Kong is now on the line," Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, said this week.\n\nHow much risk is worth it?\n\nIn recent weeks, foreign business groups -- which usually take a neutral stance on contentious political issues -- have come out against the law.

('The films that defined Generation X', 'Twenty-five years ago, when the idea of a millennial was still a twinkle in marketers’ eyes, a film was released in cinemas that set out to capture the spirit of a different generation – one to whom a Discman was cutting-edge technology and avocado was a colour in which your grandmother’s bathroom was painted. Reality Bites was not a huge commercial success in 1994 but, a quarter of a century on, it’s emerged as an iconic portrait of Generation X – the so-called forgotten generation.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Whatever happened to Generation X?\n\n- A portrait of the rave generation\n\n- Is Heathers too shocking for 2018?\n\nIn recent years, Gen X (defined as those born between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s) has been edged out of the cultural conversation as the media obsess over millennials and companies court wealthy baby boomers. But for a few years in the late 80s and early 90s, cinema was enthralled with this new breed of teens and twenty-somethings – and many of the films made by and about them have become cult favourites, from teen classics like The Breakfast Club to iconic indies like Before Sunrise.\n\nThe label Generation X emerged in 1991 with the release of Douglas Coupland’s novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture. The twenty-somethings in his book were characterised as overeducated, underemployed, cynical and disaffected – a ‘lost generation’ living in the shadow of their baby boomer parents, and rebelling against them.\n\nThough they didn’t have an official title until the early 90s, many had already come of age, and cinema was attempting to capture the mood of this new cohort. In 1985’s The Breakfast Club, John Hughes – himself a boomer – gathered a disparate gang of teenagers together in school detention. They might be “a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal” but they had one thing in common – issues with their parents, and a deep desire not to end up like them.\n\nThree years later came black comedy Heathers, which turned high school rivalries into a literal blood sport and starred new Gen X poster girl Winona Ryder as disaffected teenager Veronica. “I guess I picked the wrong time to be a human being,” she sighs to her mother.\n\nIt’s a rare appearance by a parent, largely absent from Gen X films. This was the latchkey generation, where rising divorce rates and an increase in both parents working meant many young people were left to try and figure life out for themselves.\n\nIn 1990, Time magazine published a cover story headlined ‘Twentysomething’ examining the post-boomer generation and asking if they were “laid back, late blooming or just lost?” That same year, Richard Linklater premiered his $23,000 (£15,000) film Slacker, which turned the so-called aimlessness of Gen X into an art form. Chronicling a day in the life of young people on the fringes in Austin, Texas, the camera floats from one character to the next, never lingering on one for long.\n\nThe film became a sleeper hit, eventually taking more than £1million ($1.6million) at the UK box office. Linklater has always refuted that slacker meant lazy. “Being a slacker was a very productive period in my life, though it did not look that way to anyone else,” he said. It was true. By 1995 he had released another two Generation X classics, Dazed and Confused and Before Sunrise. Both were set over 24 hours, a common formula not only for him but many Gen X directors trying to capture a snapshot of a generation. Empire Records (1995) chronicles a day in the life of a group of record store employees, while Spike Lee’s Do The Right Thing (1989) is confined to a Brooklyn neighbourhood on a sweltering hot summer’s day. It was also true of Clerks (1994) – Kevin Smith’s directorial debut, a film inspired by Slacker that was made on a budget of $28,000 (£19,000) and follows a day in the lives of two convenience store workers.\n\nTime was something this generation seemed to have a lot of. “There’s this idea that their parents’ generation, the boomers, had all these great causes that they were fighting for – civil rights, women’s rights, gay liberation,” says James Lyons, a lecturer in film at the University of Exeter. “Gen X didn’t have those causes to rally round in the same way and, without those issues, they didn’t quite know what to do or where to direct themselves.”\n\nA family affair\n\nThe emergence of friends as a new form of family, before Friends itself put the idea in the mainstream, was also a common theme. Cameron Crowe’s Singles, a romantic comedy about twenty-somethings living in the same Seattle apartment block, is one of the films most commonly associated with Generation X. Crowe – himself a baby boomer – describes it as “a story of disconnected single people making their way, forming their own unspoken family” yet insists he never set out to define a generation. But with a soundtrack featuring Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and The Smashing Pumpkins, its 1992 release coincided perfectly with the moment grunge hit the mainstream and Seattle became the most talked about city in the US.\n\nIf Singles accidentally captured a zeitgeist, other films knew exactly what they were doing. Writer Helen Childress was just 20 when a producer read a script she’d written in college and signed her up to write a movie about the lives of a group of twenty-somethings. With the working title “Untitled Baby Busters Project” – referencing an earlier term for the Gen Xers – that script went on to become Reality Bites, a major studio’s attempt to ape indies like Slacker and chronicle the twenty-something generation.\n\nGraduates stuck in dead end jobs? Check! Plaid shirts and cool soundtrack? Check! Divorced parents who don’t understand your struggle? Check!\n\n“Reality Bites is aware of the idea of Generation X in a very obvious sort of way,” says Lyons. “It’s very much Hollywood’s attempt to tap into that generation’s sensibility.” Graduates stuck in dead end jobs? Check! Plaid shirts and cool soundtrack? Check! Divorced parents who don’t understand your struggle? Check! It may have been Gen X-by-numbers, but Childress drew on her own experiences for the film to make it feel authentic, using real conversations and even real names.\n\nBy this point, with an early 1990s economic downturn in the US, Coupland’s portrayal of Gen X as overeducated and underemployed was becoming increasingly real. In the film – directed by Ben Stiller – Winona Ryder’s character Lelaina is making a documentary of her friends’ post-graduation lives, which mainly involve retail jobs, failed relationships and empty bank accounts. Ethan Hawke’s character Troy is an avatar for the cynicism frequently associated with Gen X. When Lelaina says she wants to make a difference in people’s lives, Troy snarks that he’d “like to buy them all a Coke”. Reality Bites also reflected another specific Gen X concern: selling out. At her graduation speech, Lelaina scolds her parents’ generation for swapping their 60s ideals for “a pair of running shoes”.\n\nBut if you take away the plaid and the 90s soundtrack, are these films any different to other coming-of-age stories in which young people feel misunderstood? Lyons thinks so. “There’s something about the cynicism and the irony of Generation X that was quite pronounced. The next generation of independent films don’t have that same archness and there’s more of a sincerity about them.”\n\nNo filter\n\nThere was one Gen X film, though, which was determined to show youth culture at its most raw – without any irony. Larry Clark’s Kids, written by a 19-year-old Harmony Korine, followed the lives of several teenagers over one day in Manhattan, taking in sex, drugs, rape, the spread of HIV and gang violence. The low-budget film had the feel of a documentary, with many of its cast taken straight from the streets of New York, and saw Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson make their film debuts. On release the New Yorker called it “nihilistic pornography”.\n\nKorine has said he doesn’t think Kids would get made today. If it did, it would be a different film in the digital age. Sevigny’s character spends the movie traipsing across New York to warn a former sexual partner she has HIV. Today, she could message him in seconds.\n\nRe-watching these films today, they’re notable as much for what they don’t contain as what they do. You might spot the odd pager or brick-like car phone, but there is no internet, social media or smartphones. Some of the premises would be redundant now. In Before Sunrise, Jessie and Celine would follow each other on Instagram instead of arranging to meet in the same spot in a year’s time. In Reality Bites, Leilana needn’t have worried about a TV company sabotaging her documentary. She could have just stuck it on YouTube.\n\nYet despite how different millennials’ lives may be, Lyons says they can still connect. “I teach a number of these films and movies like Slacker and Reality Bites do chime with millennial students, particularly that idea of prolonged adolescence.”\n\nToday’s woke generation might struggle with some elements, though. In Reality Bites, Troy is painted as a romantic artist whose bad behaviour is part of his charm – now his constant put-downs and gaslighting would have him quickly pinned as a jerk.\n\n“Some of the attitudes in these films absolutely haven’t aged well, particularly gender relations and social politics,” says Lyons. “The representation of Gen X also skewed very white and heavily overrepresented white college-educated twenty-somethings. African American directors like John Singleton or the Hughes Brothers get sidelined, as does the New Queer Cinema of the early 90s.”\n\nBy the time the 90s drew to a close, Generation X was starting to be reexamined. Time, the magazine that had once painted them as “lost”, devoted another cover feature to them. “Slackers? Hardly.” it wrote. “The so-called Generation X turns out to be full of go-getters.” They may have been a bunch of cynics, but Generation X turned out to be more entrepreneurial and creative than any of the films about them predicted – even if no one wants to talk about them now.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

('How to build something that lasts 10,000 years', 'When I visited Japan recently, I witnessed the 66th cycle of a ritual that began more than 13 centuries ago. I watched as Crown Princess Masako led a procession of Shinto priests carrying treasures from the old temple to the new. In Ise, they have been rebuilding the grand Jingu shrine with wood and thatch every 20 years since at least the 7th Century. As part of Shinto ritual, this not only keeps the structures intact even when made out of relatively ephemeral materials, but it allows the master temple builder to train the next generation.\n\nJapan is also home to most of the oldest companies in the world, and has a singular affection for maintenance that allows it to sustain structures and rituals for millennia. But many other cultures have created long lasting artefacts and buildings, and each one can teach us something.\n\nOver the last two decades, I have been working at The Long Now Foundation to build a monument-scale “10,000 Year Clock” as an icon to long-term thinking, with computer scientist Danny Hillis and a team of engineers. The idea is to create a provocation large enough in both scale and time that, when confronted by it, we have to engage our long-term future. One could imagine that if given only five years to solve an issue like climate change, it is very difficult to even know where to begin because the time scale is unreasonable. But if you reset the scale to 500 years, even the impossible can start to seem tractable.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nBuilding a 10,000-year machine required diving into both history and the present to see how artefacts have lasted. While we can slow the workings of the clock itself down so that it only ticks as many times in 10,000 years as a watch does in a person’s lifetime, what about the materials and location? Over the last 20 years I have studied how other structures and systems have lasted over time, and visited as many of them as I can. Some sites have been conserved by simply being lost or buried, some have survived in plain sight by their sheer mass, others have had much more subtle strategies.\n\nFew human-made objects or organisations last more than a handful of centuries, much less millennia. Stories, myths, religions, a handful of institutions, as well as some structures and artefacts have lasted this long. Most of these were not built with the intention of extreme longevity, but are accidents of history. More recent efforts such as nuclear waste sites, genealogic repositories and seed vaults, are being designed explicitly to last for thousands – or even hundreds of thousands – of years. There are a series of lessons we can learn from the past and present, ranging from material science and engineering, to the ideological. I will cover several of these as well as discuss how they have influenced our work on the 10,000 Year Clock.\n\nLost & found\n\nSome of the most unique and meaningful objects from history have survived not by intention, but by being lost and then found at an opportune moment. The Dead Sea Scrolls, the Rosetta Stone, and the Antikythera Device never would have made it to modern times without first being lost. The Antikythera Device has been of particular interest to me because it was also a planetary clock of sorts – centuries ahead of its time. It was discovered as chunks of oxidised gearing in a 2,000 year-old shipwreck near Antikythera, Greece.\n\nNo similar device has ever been found from that era. Its workmanship and understanding of gearing and celestial events are remarkable in that many of the ideas and mechanical principles would not be seen again until Europe emerged from the dark ages 1,300 years later. In addition, it would have taken many iterations to build such a device, so it is a further mystery that we don’t have any other examples of devices like this. Clearly the only reason this one survived was because it was lost. But even after being found, it languished for decades in storage before X-ray studies revealed its true complexity and purpose as a working astronomical model.\n\nThe other lesson learned for our 10,000 Year Clock project is that mechanical objects are much better at self-documentation for a future archaeologist than electronic ones. You could imagine if they had found a modern electronic device at the bottom of the Mediterranean after 2,000 years, it would be almost impossible to determine the intentions of its silicon circuits. This is one of the main reasons that we are building a large mechanical device. Even if only parts of it survive the entire 10,000 years, it is likely that people could determine its purpose and even repair it if needed.\n\nRemote places\n\nCities are defined by churn. Cities themselves can often thrive for more than 1,000 years, but the contents within them turn over with each passing decade. For every urban artefact that has lasted over a millennium, there are countless more that were destroyed by war, civic changes, or accidents. Remote places generally have created much more opportunity for long-term survival. Spectacular sites like Petra and Machu Picchu were most certainly preserved due to their distance from modern cities.\n\nAs I signed the guest book I saw the names of Jimmy Carter and Ban Ki-moon\n\nRemoteness can also lend a more mythic presence to a site. Several winters ago I travelled to the Global Seed Vault located in Svalbard, the most northern permanently inhabited place on Earth at 78 degrees latitude. The vault was designed to last for over 1,000 years as a backup repository of the world’s crop seeds. However, in building it, the designers failed to realise how much it would capture the imagination of the world. It was not designed for visitation, and they found themselves telling dignitaries who travelled there from around the world that they could only see the outside of it. In the case of our trip we had timed it to one of only two times a year they open the vault to deposit seeds. As I signed the guest book I saw the names of previous delegations that included people like Jimmy Carter and Ban Ki-moon, I realised that the remoteness of the site made it only more interesting to the outside world.\n\nRemote sites also require intention and time to reach rather than being a “drive by” location. Travelling to a specific destination means that people who visit it get transition time as they voyage there, and most importantly on their way back. For the 10,000 Year Clock site we have selected a site in far West Texas that is many hours from airports and that will require a day of hiking to visit. Since the clock project is meant to change the way people think about time, the remote site gives both anticipation and time to process the visit, making the isolation as crucial to the mythic qualities as it is to preservation.\n\nUnderground\n\nMany of the best preserved artefacts probably spent most of their time underground. The subterranean environment protects them from sunlight and generally keeps a very stable temperature. The rise and fall of temperature accelerates oxidation and aging. In fact, when manufacturers do rapid aging tests for materials, it is done largely through cycling temperatures up and down (and chemical effects, which we will get to next).\n\nThe ornate tombs of Luxor, Egypt, cave paintings such as Lascaux in the Les Eyzies valley of the Dordogne in southwestern France, and even delicate artefacts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls were all preserved underground for thousands of years. It is no wonder that modern efforts of preservation such as the Global Seed Vault, nuclear waste repositories and archives are all built beneath the surface.\n\nThere is, however, one serious drawback to trying to preserve things underground – water. I have visited nuclear waste sites in the US and Europe, the Global Seed Vault, and the Mormon Genealogical Archive – and in every case they are fighting a losing battle to keep water out. Over centuries and millennia, water will always find a way in. The only successful mitigations of water I have seen are when it is redirected rather than blocked. The ancient rice paddies of Asia are a testament to the effectiveness of carefully directing water over thousands of years.\n\nDEEP CIVILISATION This article is part of a BBC Future series about the long view of humanity, which aims to stand back from the daily news cycle and widen the lens of our current place in time. Modern society is suffering from “temporal exhaustion”, the sociologist Elise Boulding once said. “If one is mentally out of breath all the time from dealing with the present, there is no energy left for imagining the future,” she wrote. That’s why the Deep Civilisation season is exploring what really matters in the broader arc of human history and what it means for us and our descendants.\n\nBuilding the 10,000 Year Clock underground is important not only for preservation, but for timekeeping as well. Temperature change causes metals to expand and contract, requiring clever and imperfect schemes to keep devices like pendulums at the same length, and therefore keep regular time. The less temperature change a mechanical clock experiences, , the more accurate it will be. However, after witnessing the struggles with water at nearly every underground site I have visited, we had to think very carefully about how we tackle it. Our underground site is built at the top of a mountain in order to minimise the area of drainage that can collect water, but we still assume that water will get in. To address this eventuality, we angled every underground surface away from the clock and made sure that water would not be trapped anywhere and could escape at the bottom of the site. If we can’t stop the water, we can choose where to direct it.\n\nMaterials\n\nOne of the first material scientists I spoke to about making things that last for thousands of years offered a compelling insight: “Everything is burning, just at different rates.” What he means is that what we perceive as aging is actually oxidisation, like rusting. When we imagine materials that may last for thousands of years, most people think of stone or precious metals like gold – because they don\'t oxidise readily. But even bodies can be preserved for millennia if stored in the right chemical environment, as the mummies of Egypt demonstrate. Not long ago a perfectly preserved leather shoe was found in Armenia dating from over 5,500 years ago. The longevity of a material is often less about the object itself, but much more about the environment it is in. In the case of the leather shoe, it was buried in a cave and sealed in by sheep dung, thereby creating the perfect anaerobic, stable temperature environment.\n\nBut to build objects and machines that people interact with over thousands of years, we have limited ability to control that environment. People breathe the same oxygen that degrades materials, and they bring in dust on their clothes, and oil on their skin. To build a working machine that people can visit for 10,000 years, the materials themselves must be long-lasting.\n\nEven stainless steel bearings will simply weld together if left for long periods of time\n\nProbably the best example of this are the bearings that we are using for the clock. All the rotating parts in the clock require some sort of bearing surface in order to smoothly roll with minimal friction. However, there are several problems with traditional bearings, which are usually made of a row of hard steel balls between specially-ground tracks called races. Steel or even stainless steel bearings will simply weld together if left for long periods of time, and they also undergo another process called galvanic corrosion if they are separating two metals with different electrical potential. If you have ever seen the way a penny corrodes when left on another metal surface, this is galvanic corrosion. In addition to these issues, normal bearings require lubrication – but that means regular maintenance – and can attract dirt and grit.\n\nOver 20 years ago when I started this project in researching bearings, we found the perfect solution: an all ceramic bearing created for use in satellites and spacecraft. Made of near-diamond hard industrial ceramics, these bearings were designed to operate without lubrication in the vacuum of space indefinitely. There was only one problem: when I first heard of these bearings, they cost tens of thousands of dollars and were only used in aerospace. Over the course of our project, however, they have become more common and are now used in roller blades and fidget spinners and can cost as little as $10.\n\nSacrifice\n\nOne of the more surprising strategies for longevity is actually to sacrifice some part of the object itself. We see this in nature where a lizard’s tail can break off when attacked, allowing the lizard to escape alive.\n\nSome sites have this same quality, like the tombs in the Egyptian Valley of Kings, where the best preserved examples of carvings and colour look like they could have been finished just yesterday. When the grave robbers spent all their time stealing the gold objects out of the tombs, they thought they had extracted all the value, but they left the wall art untouched, which was rare when compared to other sites.\n\nThe jewel-encrusted walls of the Taj Mahal may also have helped preserve the structure by assuming all the value had been taken out with the gems. This poses an interesting question for the site we are creating for the clock. Should we have a relatively easy-to-plunder valuable layer that will not harm the clock if it were to be stolen?\n\nValue and ideology\n\nThe final and greatest danger to building anything that lasts is human beings themselves. In recent years we have witnessed some of the world’s oldest sites destroyed because their values or ideology were seen as in conflict. One of the more heart-breaking of these was the Taliban’s destruction of the massive Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan. It is hard to imagine a more innocuous religious symbol than a Buddha, but it was threatening enough to the Taliban to spend weeks blasting these amazing artefacts out of the cliffs.\n\nHow do we make something of value and cultural significance that will not at some point be stolen or destroyed? This is the true question when we ask how to build something like the 10,000 Year Clock. It is not the engineering of the materials and its workings, but the civilisation around it, which we hope to shape as one that cares for both the present and the future. We hope that by building such things, they challenge us not just technically, but ethically as well. We hope that they challenge us to become better ancestors.\n\n--\n\nAlexander Rose is executive director at the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.

('How to tell if you’ve got \'pre-burnout\'', 'If you said you were suffering from ‘burnout’ in the early 1970s, you might have raised some eyebrows.\n\nAt the time, the term was used informally to describe the side effects that heavy drug users experienced: the general dimming of the mental faculties, for example, as was the case with many a party animal. However, when German-American psychologist Herbert Freudenberger first recognised the problem of burnout in New York City in 1974, at a clinic for addicts and homeless people, Freudenberger wasn’t thinking of drug users.\n\nThe clinic’s volunteers were actually struggling, too: their work was intense, and many were beginning to feel demotivated and emotionally drained. Though they had once found their jobs rewarding, they had become cynical and depressed; they weren’t giving their patients the attention they deserved. Freudenberger defined this alarming new condition as a state of exhaustion caused by prolonged overwork – and borrowed the term ‘burnout’ to describe it.\n\nBurnout has three elements: feelings of exhaustion, mental detachment from one’s job and poorer performance at work\n\nIts popularity was explosive, and today burnout is a global phenomenon. Although statistics on the prevalence of burnout specifically are hard to come by, 595,000 people in the UK alone suffered from workplace stress in 2018.\n\nSportspeople get it. YouTube stars get it. Entrepreneurs get it. Freudenberger himself eventually got it. Late last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the trendy problem will be recognised in the latest International Classification of Diseases manual, where it is described as a syndrome “resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed”.\n\nAccording to the WHO, burnout has three elements: feelings of exhaustion, mental detachment from one’s job and poorer performance at work. But waiting until you’re already fully burned out to do something about it doesn’t help at all –and you wouldn’t wait to treat any other illness until it was too late.\n\nFeeling the burn\n\nSo how can you tell if you’re almost – but not quite – burned out?\n\n“A lot of the signs and symptoms of pre-burnout would be very similar to depression,” says Siobhán Murray, a psychotherapist based in County Dublin, Ireland, and the author of a book about burnout, The Burnout Solution. Murray suggests looking out for creeping bad habits, such as increased alcohol consumpution and relying on sugar to get you through the day. Also watch out for feelings of tiredness that won’t go away. “So that even if you do sleep well, by 10 in the morning you’re already counting down the hours to bed. Or not having the energy to exercise or go for a walk.”\n\nAlthough there are many treatment options for depression, burnout is still best tackled by making lifestyle changes\n\nAs soon as you begin to feel this way, Murray advises going to see your doctor.\n\n“Depression and pre-burnout are very similar, but as much as there was a lot of enthusiasm recently that burnout has now become a medical condition, it is still not – it is still classified as an occupational phenomenon.” It’s important to get help from a medical professional who can distinguish between the two, because although there are many treatment options for depression, burnout is still best tackled by making lifestyle changes.\n\nAnd how do you know if you’re really on the cusp of burnout, or just going through a challenging month? “Stress is really important, and anxiety is what motivates us to do well,” says Murray. “It’s when we’re continually exposed to stress and anxiety, that we’re not letting go, that it starts to turn into burnout.”\n\nTake that big project you’ve been working on. It’s normal to feel a kick of adrenaline when you think about it, and maybe it’s kept you up at night. But, Murray suggests, if you still feel restless once it’s over, it’s time to consider if you’re at risk of burnout. “It’s when you’re bringing that with you into the next stage of your day, and adding to it continually,” she says.\n\nWhen we’re continually exposed to stress and anxiety, that we’re not letting go, that it starts to turn into burnout – Siobhán Murray\n\nAnother classic sign of inching closer to burnout is cynicism: feeling like your work has little value, avoiding social commitments and becoming more susceptible to disappointment.\n\n“Someone on the brink will probably begin to feel emotionally numbed or mentally distant,” says Jacky Francis Walker, a psychotherapist based in London who specialises in burnout. “Like they don’t have the capacity to engage as much in the ordinary things of life.”\n\nShe also recommends looking for the final tell-tale sign of burnout, which is the unshakeable feeling that the quality of your work is beginning to slip. “People say ‘but this isn’t me!’, ‘I’m not like this’, ‘I can usually do x,y and z’. But obviously if they are in a state of physical depletion, then they aren’t in their normal range of capabilities,” says Walker.\n\nIf this seems less than scientific, look to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a test designed to measure burnout. The most widely used is the MBI-General Survey, which measures things like exhaustion, cynicism, and some how well you think you’re doing at work.\n\nFirst published in 1981, it has been cited hundreds of times in studies since. Although it’s typically used to measure burnout once it\'s in full swing, there’s no reason you can\'t apply it to see if you’re getting close.\n\nYou’re pre-burnout: What’s next?\n\nThe only way to stop burnout – and banish it for good – is to root out the underlying problem.\n\n“What do you have going on in your life that you can temporarily or permanently let go of? It might be [sleeping a lot] to recover from the physical signs of burnout, for example,” Murray says.\n\nWalker has a three-step programme, which includes figuring out why there is a mismatch between what a person can offer and what they feel they are being asked to give. “Sometimes it’s because they feel the need to be too perfect, or they might have imposter syndrome where they’re having to work very hard to cover up that they’re not quite as good as everyone thinks.”\n\nAccording to a 2018 study, burnout stems from unfair treatment at work, an unmanageable workload and a lack of clarity about what a person’s role should involve\n\nHowever, sometimes the work environment is the problem. According to a 2018 Gallup study of 7,500 US workers, burnout stems from unfair treatment at work, an unmanageable workload and a lack of clarity about what a person’s role should involve. Workers were also stressed out by a lack of support from their manager and unreasonable time pressure.\n\n“Another issue can be that the values of the company are seriously at odds with the person’s own values, which creates a sense of strain and dissonance, because they’re doing something that they don’t believe in,” says Walker. In some cases, her clients can solve the problem by taking up something fulfilling outside work, but very occasionally they decide to make a more radical change, such as changing companies or even taking up a new profession.\n\nWhatever the cause of your burnout, Murray’s top tip is to be kind to yourself.\n\nIn Murray\'s experience, a key driver of the burnout epidemic is today’s culture of wanting it all. Often it’s just not possible to have a healthy social life and deliver on a big project, and meet all your personal fitness goals all at the same time. She says it\'s crucial to prioritise and not expect too much of yourself; when others seem like the perfect boss parent, fitness idol and friend all at the same time, they\'re probably misleading us – or at the very least getting a lot of help.\n\nIf you feel that you might be close to joining the burnout club, take a step back, figure out what’s going wrong – and let yourself off the hook.\n\n--\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called "If You Only Read 6 Things This Week".

('The maths problem that could bring the world to a halt', 'It’s not easy to accurately predict what humans want and when they will want it. We’re demanding creatures, expecting the world to deliver speedy solutions to our increasingly complex and diverse modern-day problems.\n\nOver the last few decades, researchers have developed a range of pretty effective mathematical solutions that can allocate resources across a variety of industries and scenarios so they can attempt to keep up with the daily demands our lives place on them. But when an allocation made at one time affects subsequent allocations, the problem becomes dynamic, and the passing of time must be considered as part of the equation. This throws a mathematical spanner in the works, requiring these solutions to now take into account the changing and uncertain nature of the real world.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n• What’s the 3.5% rule of revolutions?\n\n• How to transform society’s view of time\n\n• Why the internet is breaking up\n\nSuch problems are collectively known as dynamic resource allocation problems. They crop up anywhere you find a limited resource that needs to be assigned in real time.\n\nWhether you’re waiting for a taxi or a next-day delivery, the list of dynamic resource allocation problems and their everyday applications is “almost endless” according to Warren Powell, an engineer at Princeton University who has been investigating these problems since the 1980s.\n\nBut dynamic resource allocation problems are not just concerned with giving humans what they want, when they want it. They will also be essential for tackling some of the world’s most fundamental and complex issues, including climate change, as they help us allocate our planet’s often scarce and depleted resources in the most efficient ways possible.\n\nBut let’s first look at a simplified example to see what a dynamic resource allocation problem is and what makes it so difficult to solve.\n\nImagine you’re cooking a roast dinner for your family of four. You opt for beef with all the trimmings, safe in the knowledge that it’s a firm family favourite. But just as you’re about to serve up, your daughter announces she’s vegetarian, your partner texts to say they’re running late, and your son tells you he’s invited “a few” friends over for dinner too. Then, your dog runs off with the joint of beef while you’re desperately trying to work out how you are going to meet the needs of all these (quite frankly) very demanding and unruly individuals.\n\nThey will be essential for tackling some of the world’s most fundamental and complex issues, including climate change\n\nThis is a trivial example of a dynamic resource allocation problem, but it demonstrates some of the core challenges researchers face when tackling these problems. For starters, the parameters affecting demand change unexpectedly both in the short and long term. There’s no way you could have accurately predicted your daughter’s new dietary requirements, your partner’s tardy arrival or your son’s additional guests as you were prepping this meal.\n\nIn the longer term, demand for meals in your house also changes on a day-to-day basis. You may need to feed two or 20 people at each sitting. From meal to meal, you have no idea who’ll want feeding, what they will want or when they will want it. You can take an educated guess based on prior experience, but this is not a robust method because human nature and the many other parameters affecting demand are unpredictable.\n\nThe actions of the individuals in this scenario also affect the future state of the system. Every time you allocate a specific meal to a person, this changes the system. It removes both one hungry person and food from your kitchen.\n\n“All [dynamic resource allocation] examples need to deal with changing inputs and environments, which are highly dynamic and difficult to estimate and predict, as the future load is not statistically dependent on the current load,” says Eiko Yoneki, a senior researcher leading the data centric systems group at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory. “One change triggers another change, and if you want to control the system with accurate decisions, one must consider the future status of the system.”\n\nWhat’s more, as more people or meal options come into your kitchen, things are complicated further. You now have more ways to allocate a range of different meals to different people. This number of combinations scales exponentially as you add more people or meals to the system.\n\nThis is exactly what a large hospital may face, for example, when trying to feed all the patients coming through its doors. The same applies when trying to treat these patients. The medicines they require, which themselves have a limited shelf life, and the equipment needed for diagnosis and treatment will change constantly as different patients arrive. Limited resources like MRI scanners, doctors and nurses need to be allocated too. To address this, and prevent costs from soaring out of control, the hospital management might deploy mathematical models to help coordinate all these things.\n\nThe trouble is that most existing methods rely on historical data to make predictions. This method doesn’t scale very well for such systems and can’t cope with even the smallest changes. If a change does occur, they go back to square one and start working out a solution all over again. Such problems quickly become computationally intractable, even for a fairly small number of people and resources – whether that’s a meal or an MRI scanner.\n\nDynamic resource allocation problems also arise from a range of different scenarios and each one has its own specific issues. For example, Yoneki is investigating the implications of these problems to help our computer systems and applications run faster and more efficiently.\n\n“Modern computer systems are complex, and many configuration parameters need to be tuned, including resource allocation such as memory, computation capacity, communication capability, and any input to the systems,” she says. “Computer systems are dynamic and deal with ever-changing environments, which requires dynamic control methodology.”\n\nMobile phone networks and cloud computing are reliant upon solving these problems too\n\nSo, the computer you are reading this article on is almost certainly wrestling with some dynamic resource allocation issues at this very moment. Mobile phone networks and cloud computing are reliant upon solving these problems too.\n\nDelivery firms are also tackling dynamic resource allocation problems to speed up deliveries. For example, UPS developed its On-Road Integrated Optimisation and Navigation (Orion) system to optimise its delivery routes using advanced algorithms. The company claims the solution has saved it 100 million miles per year – but other reports reveal the system struggles in complex urban environments.\n\nSupply chains are another “problem that is never going to go away”, says Powell, because of the complex nature of today’s products. For example, if you want to manufacture a standard smartphone you need to coordinate hundreds of components from around the globe, all of which are brought together in a specific order on the factory floor. “Supply chain disruptions are a major problem when trying to meet the needs of society,” he adds.\n\nOur energy supplies are also increasingly complex, relying on unpredictable renewables such as wind and solar. The outputs of these sources can fluctuate wildly, as can demand for energy at any given time. The cost of energy can fluctuate too – electricity prices can spike up to 50 times their average within a five-minute period.\n\nIn truth, you will struggle to find an industry that doesn’t faces the challenges of managing a dynamic resource allocation problem in one form or another. “Electricity prices, yield of parts in a supply chain, travel times, equipment failures, and the behaviour of people are all issues I have had to deal with,” says Powell. “This problem is so rich that there are at least 15 distinct research communities working on this problem from different perspectives.”\n\nThis is an important point. The diversity of dynamic resource allocation problems means there needs to be industry-wide standardisation of the different computational techniques and methods used to tackle it. Powell is one of those attempting to bring together the disparate communities working on dynamic resource allocation problems. “Our approach does not replace any prior work,” he says. “Rather, it brings all of this work together and helps to identify opportunities for cross-fertilisation.”\n\nAdvances in machine learning are offering new hopes of tackling dynamic resource allocation problems\n\nA rich set of operational management tools have been highly effective over the last few decades to address dynamic resource allocation problems, helping the world’s airlines, logistics firms and road networks increase their performance in a range of ways. However, “high dimensionality” – where many different parametres need to be taken into account – and uncertainty “remains a challenge”, according to Powell.\n\nAdvances in machine learning are offering new hopes of tackling dynamic resource allocation problems. An artificial intelligence technique called deep reinforcement learning allows an algorithm to learn what to do by interacting with the environment. The algorithm is designed to learn without human intervention by being rewarded for performing correctly and penalised for performing incorrectly. By attempting to maximise rewards and minimise penalties, it can quickly reach an optimal state.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning recently enabled the AlphaGo program from Google’s DeepMind to defeat the world champion in Go. The system started off knowing nothing about the game of Go, then played against itself to train and optimise its performance. While games are an important proof of concept for deep reinforcement learning techniques, learning how to play games is not the end goal for such methods.\n\nYoneki and her team have been working on providing a viable alternative to human-generated heuristics for performance tuning in computer systems using deep reinforcement learning. The computer system they have been developing can scale to solve decision-making problems that were previously computationally intractable. It addresses the issue of computational complexity and can also respond to changing parameters in real time.\n\nSystems employing this approach have already been used to optimise system performance in areas including resource management, device payment optimisation and data centre cooling. “Such applications are just at the beginning and open up a whole new world of opportunities,” says Yoneki.\n\nA team of researchers at an artificial intelligence startup called Prowler.io, based in Cambridge in the UK, is also using its own machine learning approach to tackle dynamic resource allocation problems. Its algorithms provide incentives to induce a specific behaviour in the system. In a real-world context, this could be equivalent to introducing smart tolls to incentivise drivers to use specific roads and minimise traffic congestion and pollution.\n\nAs our populations continue to grow and our hunger for on-demand services increases, the complexity of dynamic resource allocation problems will only intensify\n\nBut there is still much work to be done in the machine learning field, says Yoneki.\n\n“Use of reinforcement learning will move dynamic resource allocation problems forward, but it requires a lot of data to build a reinforcement learning model, and it is still at an experimental stage, especially computer systems where more complex parameters have to be dealt with than simple game cases,” she says. “The research on this topic is rapidly progressing.”\n\nWe’re still some way off cracking this unique set of problems as today’s techniques and computational resources quickly run out of steam when we try to tackle the complexity and random nature of the real world. But as our populations continue to grow and our hunger for on-demand services increases, the complexity of dynamic resource allocation problems and their impact on our day-to-day lives will only intensify.\n\nAnd if we don’t start to address dynamic resource allocation problems now, we won\'t just struggle to get dinner on the table – the entire world could grind to a halt.\n\n--\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

('The unique culture of Japanese convenience stores', 'In her popular novel, Convenience Store Woman, Japanese author Sayaka Murata tells the story of Keiko Furukura, a worker at an unnamed convenience store who is struggling to find a place in a traditional society due to her status as an unmarried 36-year-old with a blue-collar job.\n\nHowever, the true star of the unorthodox character’s story is her workplace, described as a tiny ecosystem, aimed not only at providing consumers nourishment, but also infusing their lives with new sources of joy.\n\n“A convenience store is not merely a place where customers come to buy practical necessities,” said Furukura in the novel’s opening pages. “It has to be somewhere they can enjoy and take pleasure in discovering things they like.”\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n• Japan’s ultimate travel food\n\n• How ‘real’ soy sauce should taste\n\n• Japan’s mysterious moving meal\n\nAlthough I read the Akutagawa Prize-winning novel before my trip to Japan, the description above struck me as overly romantic. However, as someone who has made the mistake of equating fast food with low quality, I was surprised to find that Japanese convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven, Family Mart and Lawson (the three companies that claim the lion’s share of the Japanese market), served as an introduction to local tastes, leading me to skip the basic crisps I’d usually grab at home in favour of sampling flavours like mayonnaise, ume (a fruit in the plum family) and soy sauce.\n\nI also found myself considering freshly made onigiri rice balls, grab-and-go udon noodles and traditional buns with flavours like pizza, sweet bean and pumpkin cream. It might not have been as utopic as Murata led me to believe, but even as a foreigner who needed help counting her change, the variety of the goods and the ease of finding a cheap lunch left a lasting impression.\n\nIt has to be somewhere people can enjoy and take pleasure in discovering things they like\n\nKaren Gardiner, a Scottish writer now based in the United States, lived in Tokyo for two years, beginning in 2005. As a temporary expat, she shared the joy I found in the country’s convenience stores (or ‘konbini’ as they’re referred to in Japan). Any nearby store became a regular part of her routine.\n\n“I\'d only buy food from an American convenience store if I was really desperate – actually, I went into a 7-Eleven [in Baltimore] a few weeks ago when desperate and still didn\'t buy anything,” she said. “They seem quite grim, like stuff has been sitting there for ages. I think someone visiting the US from Japan would be quite disappointed if they walked into a store here... I’d eat [in Japan] when I was out or on the way to or from work, or just needed a quick egg sandwich or onigiri.”\n\nYouTuber and Twitch streamer Cory May, who recently moved back to Japan after 20 years away from his home country, recalled his first impressions of convenience stores in the US. “I remember how weird it was to see Slushee machines and nothing but greasy hot dogs rolling around under a heat lamp at a 7-Eleven in America,” he said. “It was so weird looking to me for some reason.”\n\nGinny Tapley Takemori, Convenience Store Woman’s translator, explored some of those cultural expectations while in the US for a promotional event. However, it wasn’t disappointment she remembers experiencing, but rather confusion.\n\n“We were quite surprised that audiences seemed to think that food in Japanese convenience stores was healthy, since that is not the general perception in Japan,” she explained. “We asked our hosts in New York to show us some convenience stores there, and found the food on sale even more junkier than in Japan, so maybe that’s why!”\n\nShe continued, “I think the closest you have to convenience stores in the UK are the ones in petrol stations, which really don’t compare – they sell snacks and a few basic household essentials, but that’s about it.”\n\nIt is true that the consumer is given an unprecedented amount of choice in Japan’s fleet of convenience stores. In an attempt to appeal to locals, who often treat stores like a hub with multiple trips per week to pick up both food and household goods, new items are constantly introduced, marked with a big red sticker announcing its status as 新発売 (‘now on sale’).\n\nThe numbers are staggering: Ken Mochimaru, head of Lawson corporate communications, estimates his company’s 1,463 Tokyo-area stores each stock 3,500 different items, including baguettes stuffed with fried noodles, Pringles-branded instant noodles and pancakes pre-sweetened with maple syrup, with 100 new items introduced every month.\n\nSome of the ever-rotating additions, such as multiple flavours of Kit-Kats (including matcha and the seasonal sakura sake), or thin icing-covered biscuits called Pocky, have gained international appreciation. (Gardiner mentions cream cheese-flavoured Balance Up cookies and sweets called Konnyaku Batake Jellies as two items she misses now that she’s moved away.) But while you can find global favourites like ice cream, biscuits and chocolate bars, much of the convenience store food is often more in line with traditional Japanese flavours. Pancakes filled with red bean paste – a mass-market version of dorayaki – are popular. Mochiko, a sweetened paste made from glutinous rice, finds its way into pastries and ice creams. And then there’s matcha. Biscuits, chocolate bars, cakes – each store contains an ocean of glucose in Japan’s de facto flavour of choice.\n\nThere’s also a sense of underlying practicality to each store. Yes, snacks and novelty items are a big part of their trade, but the goal of the konbini is to be a one-stop shop for all household needs. Mochimaru highlights the bento box – pre-made, ready-to-eat meals in a box – as one such example.\n\nBefore the rise of the 1970’s feminist movement in Japan, traditional family units meant more home-cooked meals. Now, with additional women entering the workforce, more people are opting for easy-to-eat options. While I eyed an udon noodle bento box marked with 中食 to indicate its status as a nakashoku, or take-away meal, Mochimaru explained I was really looking at a piece of social cause and effect.\n\nThe convenience store has emerged as an essential part of people’s daily lives\n\n“The reason why Lawson focuses on nakashoku can be explained by the increase in the number of dual-income households,” he explained. “With both partners working, there is much less time for cooking, and bringing home bentos or ready-made dishes is a much more convenient solution. It helps to minimise the amount of time spent eating and to avoid doing the dishes.”\n\nBut more than food, Japan’s convenience stores have succeeded in becoming a required part of many people’s daily lives, because unlike many of their overseas counterparts, they also offer a host of additional services. During her time in Japan, Gardiner recalls buying concert tickets at her local shop, and even now on return visits to the city, will stop in to use the free wifi – something that Mochimaru confirmed is part of his store’s larger vision of becoming a one-stop shop.\n\n“The ongoing diversification of customer needs through the years has made today’s convenience store much more than a convenient place to shop,” he said. “As a facility whose lights stay on 24 hours a day, and which serves as a reliable cornerstone of community infrastructure in emergencies and times of disaster, the convenience store has emerged as an essential part of people’s daily lives. The role it is expected to play has expanded to unprecedented significance.”\n\nThrough both selection and ubiquity, konbini seem to have gained cultural significance. And although Takemori, who now lives in a smaller village, no longer makes daily trips to her local shop, she still speaks warmly about convenience-store culture.\n\n“I don’t think Sayaka Murata has romanticised anything about it [in her book], really, although she likes to say that she has taken elements from different stores she has worked in over the years and created her ideal store,” Takemori said. “It is instantly recognisable to anyone who has ever visited one, right from all the sounds [described] in the very first paragraph.”\n\nShe continued, “In my translation, I added in sound words (like the ‘tinkle’ of the door chime or the ‘beeps’ of the barcode scanner and so forth) that weren’t in the original to try and recreate this experience for readers who have never been in one. They are very clean, and the store workers are nearly always super attentive.”\n\nA comforting promise, for any shopper.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called "The Essential List".

('Big Little Lies series 2 review', 'This article contains spoilers for series one and the beginning of series two of Big Little Lies\n\nIt’s not the crime – it’s the cover-up. That aphorism, which goes back to the Watergate era and resonates on through contemporary politics, could serve as a perfect tagline for the captivating second season of Big Little Lies, in which the murder which ended series one lives on as a secret, haunting and rattling the main characters. This devilishly clever series about five women in beautiful, seaside Monterey still mixes soapy melodrama with the weighty themes of rape and domestic abuse, without becoming either exploitative or preachy. The added bonus for the new series: Meryl Streep. She joins Nicole Kidman, as abused wife (now widow) Celeste, Reese Witherspoon as control-freak Madeline, and Laura Dern as hilariously self-absorbed business executive Renata.\n\nStreep puts her mark on the series right away as Mary Louise, who arrives in town wondering how her son, Perry (Alexander Skarsgård), really died. She is determined to find out what viewers of series one already know, that Perry was not only abusing his wife, Celeste, he had also raped Jane (Shailene Woodley) and fathered her son. When Perry hit Celeste at an outdoor school fundraiser, the other women leapt to protect her, but it was Bonnie (Zoe Kravitz) – married to Maddie’s ex, in one of the soapier details – who pushed him down the stairs to his death.\n\nStreep’s performance is delicious and wily\n\nAs series two begins, Bonnie is suffering from PTSD, Celeste is fearful that her two small sons might have inherited their father’s violent personality and they are all sticking to the cover story that Perry fell accidentally. Mary Louise isn’t having it.\n\nStreep’s performance is delicious and wily. In wire-rimmed glasses and bobbed hair, Mary Louise has a soothing voice which masks her scolding manner, and a calmness that can abruptly explode into fierce anger. She is the embodiment of a passive-aggressive granny. Her grief is undeniable, but that doesn’t mean she’s a very nice person.\n\nSeries two can’t recapture the surprise of the first, but makes up for that with a new, droll tone. Some of the wittiest scenes in the early episodes are between Streep and Witherspoon “You’re very short,” Mary Louise tells Maddie in a lyrical voice. “I don’t mean it in a negative way. Maybe I do. I find little people to be untrustworthy.”\n\nLike so much of Big Little Lies, Streep’s performance is just this side of camp. One of the show’s strengths is the way its characters and actresses range from extremely realistic to over-the-top, creating an engaging mix.\n\nThe most realistic character is Celeste. This series, as in the last, Kidman gives one of her most visceral performances (which is saying a lot). Big Little Lies doesn’t diminish the seriousness of abuse, but unlike most shows it doesn’t shy away from Celeste’s complex feelings for her husband, which exist past the death she knows he deserved. She is frank about the fact that his violence often led to sex that she agreed to and enjoyed. She still misses him even though she is relieved that he is gone.\n\nNone of the male characters are as fully defined as they should be\n\nOn the other end of the scale, the most exaggerated character is Renata, so entitled that she blithely pushes her way through a crowd of little children. Dern plays Renata broadly enough to provide comic relief, yet also brings the character down to earth when she needs to.\n\nBonnie and Jane’s stories are more intriguing than their fairly lacklustre presences on screen. Jane’s already dull character now has an even duller boyfriend, who works at the aquarium with her. Frankly, now that Perry only turns up in occasional flashbacks, none of the male characters are as fully defined as they should be. Adam Scott comes closest as Ed, Maddie’s apparently meek but increasingly angry husband, whose patience with her secrets and lies has its limits. But the show is, after all, a matriarchy, full of mother-children and now, mother-in-law themes.\n\nOver the next two episodes, the identity of Jane’s rapist is revealed to people who were never meant to know about it. Money and legal troubles pop up. “I’m not going to not be rich, am I?” Renata says in pure horror. All the while, a suspicious detective keeps an eye on everyone.\n\nAs in the last, the entire series was written by David E Kelley, based on characters from Liane Moriarty’s novel. Series one was directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, but this time it is Andrea Arnold, the audacious director of taut dramas including Fish Tank and American Honey. If there were ever proof that television is still largely a writer’s medium, this is it. There is no hint of Arnold here, which makes you wonder why anyone would hire such a distinctive director only to have her colour inside the lines. But those lines hold up beautifully.\n\n★★★★☆\n\nLove TV?

('Obituary: iTunes (2001-2019)', 'The year 2001 had just begun and there was rebellion in the air. Independent Women by Destiny’s Child topped the charts. More and more people were ripping music onto their computers from CDs, or accessing it for free through file-sharing platforms like Napster. And in the midst of all this, Steve Jobs took to the stage at the Macworld Expo on a cold and rainy day in San Francisco to pronounce his vision for the future of music.\n\nStriding back and forth on stage, he spent two minutes lambasting the world’s choice of digital music players. “They’re too complex,” he railed. These programs were clunky and packed with restrictions, like limiting CD burn speed or failing to offer MP3 encoding. But he had an answer.\n\n“We’re going to change all this today,” he announced, “with something we call iTunes.” The crowd, as it so often did at Apple’s events, raised the roof with cheers.\n\nThis was the birth of a revolutionary bit of software that millions of people came to love. But iTunes lived long enough to see itself become the villain. Now, 17 years after that launch speech, Apple has finally killed off iTunes as we know it. This week the firm announced that iTunes would be split into separate apps for accessing music, podcasts and TV shows.\n\nNew jam\n\nTo understand what went so right and then so wrong for the program, one really has to go back to that pivotal speech in 2001. It was part of Jobs’ grand plan to make personal computers the centrepiece of people’s digital lives. This was the place we should manage the content of our lives – music, photos, emails and video.\n\nAs for existing efforts to organise digital music, Jobs was right. Music apps of the era were pretty awful. They looked hopelessly naff, with low-fidelity glass-effect interfaces sporting big rounded corners. Like a sort of digital mutant, a cartoon-like version of the façade on an old hi-fi. Plus, using these programs to manage libraries of MP3, WAV and AIFF files was a pain.\n\nWhether or not the record industry liked it, iTunes ended up changing how people bought music forever\n\nIt’s ironic that one of the things that irritated people about iTunes in the end was something that made it so refreshing back in its early days – its emphasis on file management. That was actually a godsend at the time.\n\nAnd iTunes looked better than would-be rivals, too. Few remember, but the code for the program was actually acquired by Apple when it bought the rights to software called SoundJam MP. The developers who made SoundJam moved in-house at Apple and tweaked their software, for example by adding the ability to burn music to CDs. Renamed “iTunes”, the program was announced nine months before the iPod, which was unveiled in October 2001.\n\nAt the iPod launch, Jobs boasted that the new device could hold 1,000 songs. It was the size of a deck of cards. With Apple’s FireWire cable, users could zap 1,000 songs from iTunes onto their iPod in less than five minutes. This was a perfect marriage of hardware and software, an ecosystem initially only usable with Macs that Apple could market as a package – and which users, naturally, would have to buy into in full in order to receive all the benefits.\n\nHell freezes over\n\nThe iTunes store launched in 2003, allowing people to buy music directly from Apple, and allowing artists to distribute their music without having to sign for a major licensing company. In its first week, one million downloads were sold, ousting Walmart and Best Buy as the top music retailers in the US. iTunes was so popular that PC users craved it, and it launched on Windows in the same year – what Jobs joked as hell freezing over. The program quickly become a place where one both bought and curated one’s digital music collection. Whether or not the record industry liked it, it ended up changing how people bought music forever.\n\nLooking back, it’s obvious iTunes wanted to be seen as the digital equivalent of a carefully crafted shelf of treasured vinyl records. The format may not have lasted the test of time, but you can understand why Apple wanted to give digital music a prestige feel. After all, people were paying money for each of those MP3s – about 99 cents in the US or 99p in the UK – at a time when pirated music, downloaded freely and illegally via peer-to-peer programs like Napster, was very common.\n\niTunes was without a doubt the thing that legitimised paying for music, TV shows and films that you downloaded from the internet. I still remember watching the blue progress bar shimmer and slowly tick upwards as I downloaded a film I had purchased over a mediocre broadband connection. It was charming in a weird way.\n\nAnd the very word podcast comes from “iPod” and “broadcast” – where did most people get their podcasts? iTunes. Podcasting today is booming and although audio blogging predates iTunes, the program was instrumental in introducing people to this form of entertainment in the early 2000s.\n\niTunes was without a doubt the thing that legitimised paying for music, TV shows and films that you downloaded from the internet\n\nMany people encountered the concept of a playlist for the first time thanks to iTunes. And there was fun to be had with network features. At university, I and others shared playlists of our favourite tracks via iTunes so we could listen to each other’s music collections privately. And then go and tell people which songs sucked and which ones didn’t.\n\nIn his biography of the Apple co-founder, Walter Isaacsson describes Steve Jobs showing iTunes to a New York Times journalist the afternoon after he gave his 2001 speech. The psychedelic patterns on screen – visual accompaniments that twisted and flexed as songs played – made Jobs relive dropping acid when he was younger. He said that people who had never taken the drug would never fully understand him. With iTunes, Apple created the platform that really allowed people to turn on, tune in and drop out.\n\nSign of the times\n\nBut eventually the program suffered from its own ambition. It incorporated too many functions and different types of media, including “iTunes LPs”, which gave users music as well as additional content about, say, a classic rock album. Instead of just being a bucket for all your music, it became a digital media behemoth, a shop, a device manager and a DJ.\n\nAll of that functionality required constant updates, which frustrated users. And the program seemed to become slower and less easy to use with time, not the other way around.\n\nThere were other missteps. In 2014, Apple famously caused outrage by giving a free copy of the U2 album Songs of Innocence to everyone with an iTunes account, whether they wanted it or (mainly) not. Its 20,000-word-long terms and conditions was longer than Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night. And far less entertaining.\n\nHow could a program that manages a finite collection of digital media on your own hard-drive compete with services like Spotify or YouTube that give you access to seemingly infinite content online?\n\nMost of all, though, iTunes was a victim of changing technology. As high-speed broadband became the norm, streaming music and even HD films has become commonplace. How could a program that manages a finite collection of digital media on your own hard-drive compete with services like Spotify or YouTube that give you access to seemingly infinite content online?\n\nThere’s been plenty of debate over whether streaming is having a negative impact on music, but from a listening functionality point of view, it’s hard to praise a system like iTunes over it.\n\nAll of which may explain the response to the news of iTunes retirement. Among those applauding the execution of this once-celebrated program was Wired, which said, “good riddance” and The Verge, which described iTunes as “Apple’s most hated app”. Not everyone is dancing on iTunes’ grave, though, including Billy Steele at Engadget who writes, “iTunes isn\'t dead, it\'s multiplying.”\n\nThat may be true in an even broader sense. The basic template for interacting with music digitally was laid down by iTunes. We might stream the content now, but playlists, sharing and portability are still at the core of the digital listening experience. For many, the place where they first learned that such things could exist was not some website – it was iTunes.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
